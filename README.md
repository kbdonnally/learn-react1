Sources:

- Code from CodePen download. [Find code here](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/oWWQNa).

### Updates:

- Added Babel, thus the package.json
- Pasting in React links from CodePen so can run locally

## Part 2: Learning React via Docs

- Restructuring environment in here a bit for better learning
- Added a Gulpfile to process custom CSS & process Babel for me
- Renaming files & splitting up into diff JS & SCSS files so can better keep track of styles & functions
